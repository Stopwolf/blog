I'm a machine learning engineer working part-time at [Intellya](https://intellya.ai/), a company developing ML-focused software. My job includes creating analytical modules for our products such as [SelectaCRM](selectacrm.app) and [Weaver](weaverbot.ai) bot, but also industrial R&D.

In September 2021, I defened my Bachelor's thesis called "Recommender Systems based on Bipartite Graph Neural Networks" at [Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade](fon.bg.ac.rs/eng/) and thus graduated with an average of 9.66/10. Currently, I'm doing a Master's degree at the same university, with primary focus on machine learning.

## Some fun stuff

* I love climbing! Or bouldering to be exact.. After being a national champion at 11 years old, and a pause of the same length, I'm back and giving it my all on the wall.
* When it comes to other sports, in basketball I bleed green for Boston Celtics, and in F1 red for Scuderia Ferrari.
* I play drums, but currently just by myself. My favourite type of ganre to play to is pop/electronic genre, but I don't shy away from anything. Example is Chansmoker's drummer [Matt McGuire](https://www.youtube.com/c/MattMcGuireOfficial).
* I recently fell in love with Portugal and its culture, so I started learning European Portuguese by myself.. mas ainda falo apenas um pouco de portuguÃªs.
* Two more random facts about me are that I meditate and don't eat chocolate for about 3 and a half years currently.
