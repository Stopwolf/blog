I'm a third year student studying Information Systems and Technology at Faculty of Organizational Sciences in Belgrade, Serbia.

When I'm not studying for my exams, I'm working part-time for [Saga NFG](https://saga.rs/?lang=en) as ML Programmer, creating ML-based solutions for the analytical module of Selecta CRM software. Have a look <a href='www.selectacrm.app'>here</a>!

I'm also interested in biology and medicine and would like to explore the overlap of the two with Machine Learning.

In my actual free time I like to play basketball, meditate, workout, read and learn new stuff.
