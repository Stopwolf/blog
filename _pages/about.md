I'm a third year student studying Information Systems and Technology in Belgrade, Serbia.

When I'm not studying for my exams, I'm working part-time for [Saga NFG](https://saga.rs/?lang=en) as ML Engineer, creating ML-based solutions for one of the biggest banks in this part of Europe.

In my actual free time I like to play basketball, meditate, workout, read and learn new stuff.
