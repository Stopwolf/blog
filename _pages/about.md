I'm a final year student studying Information Systems and Technology at Faculty of Organizational Sciences in Belgrade, Serbia.

When I'm not studying for my exams, I'm working part-time for [Saga NFG](https://saga.rs/?lang=en) as ML Programmer, creating ML-based solutions mainly in the financial sector. I participated in the creation of the analytical module of [Selecta CRM software](https://www.selectacrm.app).

I'm interested in biology :dna: and medicine :stethoscope:, but also in big problems like privacy :lock: and climate change :thermometer:, and would like to explore the overlap of the these with machine learning.

In my actual free time I like to play basketball :basketball:, meditate ðŸ§˜, workout :weight_lifting_man:, read and learn new stuff :book:.
