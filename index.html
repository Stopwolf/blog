Welcome to my blog where I post about machine learning topics I recently learned about! I made this mainly to fuel my will to learn and share new things with the world.

If you're interested in how this site is built, the answer is with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)!

[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) automates the process of creating blog posts via GitHub Actions, so that you don't have to fuss with conversion scripts.
The best part is that you can directly post your Jupyter Notebooks as blog posts!
